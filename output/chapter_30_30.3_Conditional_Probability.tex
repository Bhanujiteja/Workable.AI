Here is the list of LaTeX-formatted question strings:

"If $P(A) = 0.5$, find $P(A')$.",
"If 8 possible outcomes are equally likely, find the probability that the die shows a number greater than 4 if it is known that the first throw of the coin results in a tail.",
"If a coin is tossed twice and the four possible outcomes are assumed to be equally likely. If $A$ is the event, ‘both head and tail have appeared', and $B$ be the event, ‘at most one tail is observed', find $P(A)$, $P(B)$, $P(A/B)$ and $P(B/A)$.",
"Let there be a bag containing 5 white and 4 red balls. Two balls are drawn from the bag one after the other without replacement. Consider the following events: $A = $ Drawing a white ball in the first draw. $B = $ Drawing a red ball in the second draw. Now, $P(B/A) = $ Probability of drawing a red ball in second draw given that a white ball has already been drawn in the first draw.",
"If $A$ and $B$ are two events such that $P(A) = 0.5$, $P(B) = 0.6$ and $P(A \cup B) = 0.8$, find $P(A/B)$ and $P(B/A)$.",
"If a die is rolled three times. Find $P(A/B)$ and $P(B/A)$, if $A = $ 4 appears on the third toss, $B = $ 6 and 5 appear respectively on first two tosses.",
"Mother, father and son line up at random for a family picture. If $A$ and $B$ are two events given by $A = $ Son on one end, $B = $ Father in the middle, find $P(A/B)$ and $P(B/A)$.",
"A die is thrown three times. Find $P(A/B)$ and $P(B/A)$, if $A = $ 4 appears on the third toss, $B = $ 6 and 5 appear respectively on first two tosses.",
"A die is thrown twice and the sum of the numbers appearing is observed to be 6. What is the conditional probability that the number 4 has appeared at least once?",
"Two dice are thrown. Find the probability that the numbers appeared has the sum 8, if it is known that the second die always exhibits 4.",
"A pair of dice is thrown. Find the probability of getting 7 as the sum, if it is known that the second die always exhibits an odd number.",
"A pair of dice is thrown. Find the probability of getting 7 as the sum if it is known that the second die always exhibits a prime number.",
"A pair of dice is thrown. Find the probability of getting the sum 8 or more, if 4 appears on the first die.",
"Find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing on two dice is 8, given that at least one die does not show five.",
"It is evident from the Venn-diagram that $A \cap B$ and $A' \cap B$ are mutually exclusive events such that $(A \cap B) \cup (A' \cap B) = B$. Therefore, by addition theorem on probability, we have $P(A \cap B) + P(A' \cap B) = P(B)$.",
"A die is rolled. If the outcome is an odd number, what is the probability that it is prime?",
"A pair of dice is thrown. Find the probability of getting the sum 8 or more, if 4 appears on the first die.",
"Find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing on two dice is 8, given that at least one die does not show five.",
"A doctor is to visit a patient. From the past experience, it is known that the probabilities that he will come by train, bus, scooter or by other means of transport are respectively $3/11, 2/11, 1/11$ and $5/11$. The probability that he will be late are $2/3, 1/4, 1/12$ and $0$ if he comes by train, bus, scooter and other means of transport respectively, but if he arrives, he is late. What is the probability that he comes by train?"
